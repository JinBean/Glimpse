# Motivation

Singapore has a large number of recreational spaces in every neighbourhood that are free for everyone to use. These spaces include basketball courts, badminton courts, street soccer courts, and even playgrounds. However, the want to use these public spaces can be hindered by the lack of knowledge as to whether the space is occupied at any given time. This problem has yet to been solved even till today. Our project aims at solving this problem in an effective and convenient way.


# Our Solution

Our solution includes adding a small camera that overlooks each space. This camera, with the help of computer vision, will help identify the total number people using the facility at every given period of time. This information is then sent to a central database. The data is pulled by a phone application which can then be accessed by everyone with that application installed. Only the numerical capacity will be displayed on the app and not the pictures taken as to provide as much information as possible while still maintaning privacy.


# Implementation

As a proof of concept, we will be applying our solution on a smaller scale within our school campus.
